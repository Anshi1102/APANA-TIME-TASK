# APANA-TIME-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT  
Step 1: Python Code using Data set.xlsx  
- Load the data from the 'Data set.xlsx' file using Python.  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including calculating:  
    - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)  
    - Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range)  
    - Skewness  
    - Kurtosis

Step 2: SQL Code using Data set.xlsx  
- If the data is in a SQL database, write SQL queries to perform EDA.  
- Calculate:  
    - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)  
    - Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)  
    - Skewness and kurtosis

Step 3: Excel Code using Data set.xlsx  
- Open 'Data set.xlsx' in Excel.  
- Use Excel functions to calculate:  
    - Measures of central tendency  
    - Measures of dispersion  
    - Skewness  
    - Kurtosis

Step 4: Create an Interactive Dashboard  
- Use tools like Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.  
- The dashboard should allow users to:  
    - Select columns  
    - Visualize data distributions  
    - Interact with the statistical results
